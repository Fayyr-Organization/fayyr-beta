# Welcome to the Fayyr beta test!

Welcome to the Fayyr beta testing overview document! This document is designed to get you ready to participate in the 
testing of our new charity-focussed website, where we are working with charities and artists to sell NFTs in support
of great causes.

## Requirements

To participate, you need a white-listed NEAR account on testnet. ???We will supply one? or make one and send us the id?

## Help and reporting issues

We'd love it if you report any issues using github issues. Just click the 'issues' tab above and click 'New Issue' on the 
right and tell us what the problem is.

We've also set up a discord server (???) so you can talk to each other and us to quickly answer questions you might have.  Hopefully
the site is pretty self-explanatory, but no doubt we missed *something* :).

## Additional roles

There are three main roles in our site, and we'd love people to try them all out (only one at a time, though).

- Donor: A user who can go on the site and buy NFTs to support charities. They can also sell NFTs, resulting in royalties for charities and artists.

- Artist: An artist is like a user, but they can also mint art for their favorite charities. Pick an image or animated gif that you like, and upload it using ipfs (instructions on the website). Then send it to the charity for approval and see it go live, get sold, and support the charity. You will also get a royalty with every sale, so everyone wins!

- Charity: This is a bit more of a 'management' role. You can be your favorite charity (actually we'll assign you one), and approve art to be sold in your name by artists.  You can also mint art for yourself! Of course, you can also watch the money role in.

If you'd like to try out one of those other roles, simply let us know on our discord.

## Rewards

Of course, we couldn't bulletproof our website without you. So, we've set up a rewards system to help us thank you for
your time and hard work.  We've tried to keep it simple and -- Fayyr (I couldn't resist) -- while gathering useful feedback
to make our launch a successful one.

## Notes to self
- what, if anything, are we doing for receipts in the beta?
