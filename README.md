# Welcome to the Fayyr Beta test!

Welcome to the Fayyr beta testing overview document! This document is designed to get you ready to participate in the 
testing of our new charity-focussed website, where we are working with charities and artists to sell NFTs in support
of great causes.

## Requirements

To participate, you need an allow-listed NEAR account on testnet. If you want to be a 'donor' or an 'artist' (see [roles](#roles) below), 
you can send us your account id after you've created it: by [email](mailto:beta@fayyr.com) or on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/MG8JeeuwYV). 
To create an account, navigate to https://wallet.testnet.near.org and 
click on `Create Account`. If you want to be a 'charity', let us know and we'll send you an enabled account.

## Rewards

Of course, we couldn't bulletproof our website without you. So, we've set up a rewards system to help us thank you for
your time and hard work.  We've tried to keep it simple and -- Fayyr (I couldn't resist) -- while gathering useful feedback
to make our launch a successful one. In order to collect your rewards, just fill out this [simple form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpf8IdaUn1Yp9TDgMOr_1DwH_OBGYhkSuSPwgKurvGwSd2tA/viewform?usp=sf_link). We'll evaluate
your answers and send you some *real* NEAR!

Your total reward will be determined as follows:

1. 5 NEAR for the top 20 accounts as measured by overall contribution. Be sure to try out multiple roles and report any bugs you find.  
1. 0.5 NEAR for providing a useful, complete form
2. 0.1 NEAR for *each* submitted, relevant, distinct and novel issue 

By participating, you're agreeing that we'll be the final arbiters of all rewards. It'll be Fayyr. Promise! (If you don't have a NEAR mainnet
account (to get the rewards), let us know a PayPal account in the form and we'll convert it to fiat currency and send it that way.)

## Help and reporting issues

We'd love it if you report any issues using github issues. Just click the `Issues` tab above and click `New Issue` on the 
right and tell us what the problem is.

We've also set up a [discord server](https://discord.gg/MG8JeeuwYV) so you can talk to each other and us to quickly answer questions you might have.  Hopefully
the site is pretty self-explanatory, but no doubt we missed *something* :).  If either of these don't seem appropriate, you can [email](mailto:beta@fayyr.com) us at
beta@fayyr.com.

## <a name="roles">Roles</a>

There are three main roles on our site, and we'd love people to try them all out (only one at a time, though).

- Donor: A user who can go on the site and buy NFTs to support charities. They can also sell NFTs, resulting in royalties for charities and artists.

- Artist: An artist is like a user, but they can also submit art for their favorite charities. Pick an image or animated gif that you like, and upload it using ipfs (instructions on the website). Then send it to the charity on the approvals tab and see it go live, get sold, and support the charity. You will also get a royalty with every sale, so everyone wins!

- Charity: This is a bit more of a 'management' role. You can be your favorite charity (actually we'll assign you one), and approve art to be sold in your name by artists.  You can also mint art for yourself! Of course, you can also watch the money roll in.

The donor is the default role, but if you'd like to be an artist or charity, simply let us know on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/MG8JeeuwYV) or via [email](mailto:beta@fayyr.com).
